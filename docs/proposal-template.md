# Introduction

This project aims to develop a secure password manager application using C#, .NET, and SQLite. The application will allow users to store and manage their passwords securely, enabling easy access and organization of their credentials.


# Anticipated Technologies

Backend Development:
C# and .NET Framework: Utilizing the .NET environment to handle business logic and interactions with the database.
SQLite: A lightweight database to store user passwords and associated metadata securely.

Frontend Development:
Windows Forms or WPF: For creating a user-friendly interface, allowing users to add, view, and manage their passwords easily.
HTML/CSS (if developing a web version): For styling and structuring the user interface if transitioning to a web application.

Security Measures:
Encryption: Implementing strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES) to securely store passwords.
Password Strength Validation: Ensuring users create strong passwords through validation checks.

# Method/Approach

Database Design:
Designing the SQLite database to include tables for user accounts and their corresponding passwords, ensuring proper relationships and security measures.

Application Structure:
Utilizing C# classes to represent entities like Users and Passwords, following the principles of OOP for maintainability and scalability.
Implementing MVC or MVVM patterns to separate concerns and enhance code organization.

Functionality Implementation:
Creating functionalities for user registration, login, password addition, retrieval, and deletion.
Incorporating secure practices for password handling, including hashing and encryption.

# Estimated Timeline
To complete this project, the following key tasks will be addressed:

Database Design: 
Establishing a proper schema for storing user credentials securely. This task will require careful consideration of relationships and security implications.
Application Development: 
Coding the backend and frontend, ensuring smooth integration with the SQLite database. The complexity of encryption and security features may require additional time.
Testing and Refinement: 
Conducting thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work as intended and addressing any bugs or security vulnerabilities.
Estimated Completion: December 3rd to 5th.

# Anticipated Problems
Security Challenges: Implementing robust security measures may pose challenges, especially around encryption and data handling.
Database Management: Ensuring efficient and secure access to the SQLite database can lead to potential issues during implementation.
User Experience: Designing an intuitive interface that caters to all user needs while maintaining security can be a balancing act.

By addressing these areas, we aim to deliver a reliable and secure password manager application.
